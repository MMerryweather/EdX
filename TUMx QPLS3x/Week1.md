TPS

- Eliminating defects
WW2 - Shortages, small market
Eiji Toyoda changed method
	- Focus on eliminate waste
	- focus on value add
Taiichi Omo created Lean or TPS
TPS focus on
	- JIT
	- QC and Improvement
	- Waste & cost control

Core elements of TPS
	- Maximize share of value add activities
	- Eliminate wase
	- single part flow
	- stable, standardized process
	- workplace organize
	- Self-learning continuousing improviing problems
	-Regorous RCA
	- Continuous improve erry day
	- holistic supply chain
		- backward integration which include suppliers
	- People Development is the key success factor

# Productivity and Waste
 The 7 wastes of Lean
 	- Transportation
	- Inventory
	- Motion
	- Waiting
	- Over-processing
	- Overproduction
	- Defects
  (TIM WOOD)

  Think of Productivity as
  	$ Total Outputs / $ Value of all Inputs Used
  another way: Labour productivity
	  Labour as a resources
	  needs to be thought of output per time, whats idle in your proccess?
  Productive time needed per unit produced / Total time in process
  	% of time actually adding value
  	 focus on eliminating waste
  	 Anything not contributing to output = waste

# Transport
 	- Uncesscessary movement of materials or people within a process
 	- EG: 
 		- Storing WIP instead of moving to next step
 		- transport of Raw materials or parts due to layout
 	- Introduces double handling or opportunities for defects
 	- impacts communication, affects quality = long time to find out somethings wrong
 	- Challenge layout and transport from one function to another
 # Inventory
 	- Raw Materials, Work in Progress (WIP) or Finished Goods (FG)
 	- Inventory is often a syptom of problems in process
 		- Sea analogy, covering rocks, hides process problem
 		- low level it crashes
	- Increases op costs, conveyance, storage, obsolescence,
	- production lead time (how?)
	- Define necessary inventory size and minimize
# Motion
	- Different to transport
	- Machines or people in a process
	- Ergonomics
	- Necessitry to stretch or bend to complete task
	- Manual checks, work cycles
	- Check tooling, equipment, parts?
	- Layout optimized for varying customer demand?
# Waiting
	- Waiting for the completion of work cycle
	- Waiting is boring
	- Completion, raw materials, maintenance, etc
	- Does it need to be monitored? why?
	- Balance to eliminate idle time
	- can they do something else in the meantime?
# Over-processing
	- Producing to specs tighter than customer requires
	- Often when standards are poorly defined
	- Need to understand customer expectations
	- Clear and followed by team
# Overproduction
	- Sooner, faster or in greater quantities than customer needs
	- Producing more due to long batch times or avoiding changovers or low yield
	- Inventory or scrap = Worst
	- Need clear understanding of customer demand
# Defects
	- Internal and External
	- Cost
	- Loss of reputation or business
	- energy expending in recalls, warranties etc

# 3 M's (Mura, Muri, Muda)
	- Mura = Inconsistency, irregular
		- inside or outside of our control
		- Uneven customer demands
		- Uneven distribution of work load
		- Inconsistent quality feed
		- Irregular scheduling of work

	- Muri = Overbuden, unreasonable
		- Effort to overcome
		- People working too fast to keep up with demand
		- working long hours to make up for lost time
		- running equip to fast to hit targets
		- Overloading to get more
		- skipping maintenance to reduce downtime
		- cut corners, making mistakes, problems arise
		- work smarter, not harder

	- Muda = Waste, futile, usesless, pointless
		- Any activity not adding value for customer
		- Defined by the 7 wastes

# Application of the 3Ms to Lean Productions
	- Mura
		- Process Value Stream Mapping
		- Visual Management
		-5S (Sort, Shine, Set in Order, Standardize, Sustain)
		- Production Levelling (Heijunka)
		- Takt Time
	- Muri
		- 5S
		- Production Leveling (Heijunka)
		- Takt Time
		- Setup Time Reduction
	- Muda
		- Setyp Time Reduction
		- Just In Time
		- Error Proofing (Poka Yoke)
		- Stop and Fix (Jidoka)

	- Littles Law
		- to analyse utilisation
		- Input -> Output (Utilization 0-100%)
		- Time spent waiting or queing given by:
		T_waiting = p x (u / (1-u)) x V
			p = processing time
			v = variation in arrival and processing time
		- As utilisation approaches 1 (= overburden) the Twait goes to infinity
		- Reduce burden until you get a consistency
		- Improving capacity allows for increases productivity and performance

	Core Concepts
		- Create continuous flow and eliminate waste through quality and quantity control
		- Pull production
		- Continuous Improvement
			- Cultural
			- everyone involved

#=============================================================
# Process Flow Diagram
 - Business Process
 	- Repeatable sequence of activities
 	- Consumes time and resources
 	- clearly defined input
 	- certain output (material or immaterial)
 	- for customers (Internal or External)
 Diagrams
 	- Triangles for storage
 	- rectangle for operations
