## Week 2: Understanding Flow
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Capacity Analysis
 * Process Mapping
 	- Identifying steps and processes
 	- inputs
 	- outputs
 	- controls
 * Focus on entire system now, not just steps
 * what is a business process?
 	- Repeatable coherent set of activities
 	- consumes resources
 	- clear input
 	- certain material or immaterial outputs
 	- for customers (internal / external)
 	- not one off, repeats often as business runs
 * Transforms inputs to outputs via resources
 * How to make PFD?
 	- Arrange into flow
 	- triangle for storage
 	- rectangle for processes
