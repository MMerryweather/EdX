# Lean Notes

## Week 2: Understanding Flow
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Capacity Analysis
 * Process Mapping
 	- Identifying steps and processes
 	- inputs
 	- outputs
 	- controls
 * Focus on entire system now, not just steps
 * what is a business process?
 	- Repeatable coherent set of activities
 	- consumes resources
 	- clear input
 	- certain material or immaterial outputs
 	- for customers (internal / external)
 	- not one off, repeats often as business runs
 * Transforms inputs to outputs via resources
 * How to make PFD?
 	- Arrange into flow
 	- triangle for storage
 	- rectangle for processes

### Finding the bottleneck - Part 1

* Process Capacity = Max number of units produced per unit of time
* How to measure?
	- Materials going in
	- Resources turn materials into products
	- Demand (If no demand, don't make anything)
	- Capacity focuses on the second point
* Eg for skate board
	- 5min for assembly
	- 4min for sand
	- 6min for paint
	- **15min Total**
* If no inventory, its a sequential process
* Fords focus was on speed

#### Definitions
* Processing Time = p = time for 1 unit, eg 5, 4, 6min
* Flow Time = Time to process a unit through the process = 15min
* Resource Capacity = 1/p, max N per unit time
	- If there are m resources then its m/p
	- Capacity Example
		- Assembly: 1 / 5 = 12 boards per hour
		- Sand: 1 / 4 = 15 boards per hour
		- Paint: 1 / 6 = 10 boards per hour **BOTTLENECK**
* Process Capacity  = Minimum resource capacity in the process
	- Bottlneck, slowest process
